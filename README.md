# MetaPhysical Call For Art

## Summary
We are looking for video motion graphic art that will fill the screens at the MetaPhysical exibition with MetaFactory at Lume Studios. We are gathering footage and renders from the community to compile together for this 12 hour event that would be great to get some of the community members art up on these screens.

## What is the event about?
The event is a mixed reality exhibition themed around the open metaverse, and interoperability. We have rented a studio venue, and built the same venue in the metaverse. This event will be a mixer / meetup for blockchain enthusiasts during the week of NFT.NYC. It is a free event, and open to the public. To see the full event info, please check out this link. LINK


## Video Resolution and Submission Details
The resolution of the video we need is 9600 * 1080p

The screens in the venue are essentially 5 screens projected across 3 surfaces. Please design your art to look cool and take advantage of all this pixel space! Go for it! 

## Themes
We encourage you to have fun and possibly use the Metafactory assets, and explore themes of interoperability, avatar wearables, platform agnostic design, and the open metaverse. Have fun!P lease ubmit art in mp4 format, and message me the title and description along with your artist name and social media so that I can include in the documentation, to boomboxhead#5796 on discord. Thanks so much for rocking out with us! Much love! 

Here are some examples of the correct size for the render. IF you have any questions please feel free to reach out! -Godfrey
